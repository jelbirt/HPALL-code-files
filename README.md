# Worcester State University Human Performance and Assisted Learning Lab (HPALL) 

This repository contains Java and R code to process, analyze and visualize data for research conducted by the Worcester State University Biology Department HPALL
studying human accuracy, depth perception and precision in a 3-D Virtual Reality environment built in Unity alongside some of the visualizations produced.

## Data Processing

Collected data was presented as folders of several smaller data files for each subject.
The Java code for data cleaning implements Apache POI to consolidate data into one file per subject.
Then, the R code file was used to process the data and generate visualizations per project specifications.
